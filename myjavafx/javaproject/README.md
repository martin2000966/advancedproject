# Simulink MDL Viewer
Simulink MDL Viewer is a software tool that provides a user-friendly interface for reading Simulink MDL files using a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI). The tool allows users to load Simulink MDL files and view their contents in a hierarchical structure, navigate through the model components, and see their properties and connections. It also enables users to interactively modify the model and visualize the changes in real-time, and run simulations for simple systems using a Discrete Fixed step solver.
